CONSOLE MESSAGE: Blocked mixed content http://127.0.0.1:8000/xmlhttprequest/resources/access-control-basic-allow-star.cgi because 'block-all-mixed-content' appears in the Content Security Policy.
This test loads a secure iframe that triggers an insecure ping load. We should trigger a mixed content block because the child frame has CSP directive block-all-mixed-content.
